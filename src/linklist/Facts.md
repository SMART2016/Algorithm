#### 1.Use multiple Referance pointers for solving all Link list problems.
#### 2.Runner Technique with two pointers one fast (Hops multiple nodes with one hop of slow pointer) , slow pointer(hops one node at a time)
#### 3. Recursion is a effective technique for solving LL propblems.
  - All recursion problems takes at least O(n) spcae , n is the depth of the recursion.
